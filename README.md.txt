To run this login system, we have to initialize a Database (say, "Company"), having the following 3 fields -
1) id
2) username
3) password

The system was tested with a predefined MySQL entry for a user called "Gyan Prakash" with a password "123456". In order 
to add a new user, or delete a user or to perform any kind of change in login credentials, you would have to 
manually run corresponding queries against your own created database for the code in this repository.

Feel free to clone, share & commit.
